# ESP32 based Bluetooth Xbox Controller

This ESP32 based Controller uses [ESP32-BLE-GAMEPAD](https://github.com/lemmingDev/ESP32-BLE-Gamepad) to communicate with PC.
This library is a Playstation Controller based library. Therfore iniitally the PC sees ESP32 as a Playstation Controller(Bluetooth device).
To make it an Xbox controller, I have used [Xbox 360 Controller Emulator](https://www.x360ce.com/) , which maps the keys from playstation version to a xbox version.
