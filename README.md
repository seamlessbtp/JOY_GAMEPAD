# ESP32 based Bluetooth Xbox Controller

this esp32 Controller uses [ESP32-BLE-GAMEPAD](https://github.com/lemmingDev/ESP32-BLE-Gamepad) as communicate with PC.
This library is a Playstation Controller based library which the PC sees as a Playstation Controller.
To make it an xbox controller, I have used [Xbox 360 Controller Emulator](https://www.x360ce.com/) , which maps they keys from playstation type to a xbox version.
